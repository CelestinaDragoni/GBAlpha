# GBAlpha - *A Console-Like Case for Woozle's GBA Consolizer*

## Introduction
Included in this repository is a custom case design for Woozle's GBA Consolizer. This has a more console-like feel and has inspirations from various design choices from the PCEngine and NES. This case was designed around the maintainability of components inside being easy to disassemble and assemble and, unlike other available cases, this is a complete project with documentation, assembly, and printing instructions. If you want to know more around my thoughts and this project please read my forward [here](docs/introduction.md).
